Static Web Page about  Sergio "Checo PÃ©rez".  

## About ðŸ’¡

It's a simple responsive web page with the purpose of practicing HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, which is a framework that facilitates the web layout process, to which personally, I'm not going to invest too much time or I hope so...

## Tools ðŸ”¨

Here are the links I used for this project.  

* [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)  
* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)  
* [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)  
* [Email](https://formsubmit.co/documentation)  

Evidently, I didn't use all the elements and tools, however, I consider that it was a good result for my first project.  
The elements that I can highlight are the following:
* Navbars
* Footers
* Dropdowns
* Breakpoints
* Containers
* Media Querys
* Grid
* Forms
* Utilities
* Override styles
* Cards
* Icons
* Modify svgs
* Sending to email
* Responsive
* And more...
